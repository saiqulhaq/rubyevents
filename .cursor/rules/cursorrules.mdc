# RubyVideo Rails 8 Project - Cursor Rules

You are working on RubyVideo, a modern Ruby on Rails 8 application that aggregates and curates Ruby conference videos. This is a sophisticated video platform with AI-powered features, search, analytics, and social features.

## Project Overview

**Tech Stack:**

- Rails 8.0 with SQLite database
- Frontend: Vite + Tailwind CSS + daisyUI + Stimulus controllers
- Background Jobs: Solid Queue
- Caching: Solid Cache
- Authentication: Custom session-based auth with GitHub OAuth
- Admin: Avo admin panel
- Deployment: Kamal on Hetzner VPS
- Analytics: Ahoy for page tracking
- AI Features: OpenAI integration for summarization and topic extraction

**Architecture:**

- ViewComponent pattern for reusable UI components
- Concerns for shared model behavior
- Associated Objects pattern using `active_record-associated_object`
- Slug-based routing for SEO
- Background jobs for data processing
- YAML-based conference data structure

## Development Standards

### Ruby/Rails Code

**General Rails Conventions:**

- Follow Rails 8 conventions and modern Rails patterns
- Use `standardrb` for Ruby formatting (never `rubocop`)
- Models include concerns: `Suggestable`, `Sluggable`, `Rollupable`, `Searchable`, `Watchable`
- Prefer `belongs_to` with `optional: true` when appropriate
- Use `has_many` with `dependent: :destroy` for cascade deletes

**Model Patterns:**

```ruby
class Talk < ApplicationRecord
  include Rollupable
  include Sluggable
  include Suggestable
  include Searchable
  include Watchable
  configure_slug(attribute: :title, auto_suffix_on_collision: true)

  belongs_to :event, optional: true, counter_cache: :talks_count, touch: true
  has_many :speaker_talks, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :speakers, through: :speaker_talks

  validates :title, presence: true
  enum :kind, ["talk", "keynote", "panel"].index_by(&:itself), default: "talk"

  scope :watchable, -> { where(external_player: false) }
  scope :canonical, -> { where(canonical_id: nil) }
end
```

**Controller Patterns:**

- Inherit from `ApplicationController` which includes:
  - `Authenticable` - session-based authentication
  - `Metadata` - SEO meta tags
  - `Analytics` - page view tracking
- Use `skip_before_action :authenticate_user!` for public pages
- Follow RESTful routing patterns
- Use `Current.user` for current user access
- Implement pagination with `pagy` gem

```ruby
class TalksController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:index, :show]

  def show
    @talk = Talk.includes(:speakers, :topics).find_by(slug: params[:slug])
    return redirect_to(root_path, status: :moved_permanently) unless @talk

    @pagy, @related_talks = pagy(@talk.related_talks, limit: 6)
  end
end
```

**Authentication Patterns:**

- Session-based authentication, not JWT
- Use `Current.user` to access current user
- GitHub OAuth integration available
- Admin users have `admin: true` boolean
- Route constraints use `Authenticator` module

### ViewComponent Architecture

> **Detailed UI Component Rules**: See [viewcomponents.mdc](./viewcomponents.mdc) for comprehensive UI component guidelines.

**Component Structure:**

- All components inherit from `ApplicationComponent`
- Components located in `app/components/`
- UI components in `app/components/ui/` namespace

```ruby
class Ui::ButtonComponent < ApplicationComponent
  option :kind, type: Dry::Types["coercible.symbol"].enum(:primary, :secondary), default: proc { :primary }
  option :size, type: Dry::Types["coercible.symbol"].enum(:sm, :md, :lg), default: proc { :md }

  private

  def component_classes
    class_names(
      "btn",
      KIND_MAPPING[kind],
      SIZE_MAPPING[size]
    )
  end
end
```

**Component Conventions:**

- Use mapping constants for CSS class variants
- Implement `component_classes` method for dynamic styling
- Use `class_names` helper for conditional classes
- Support both `param` and `option` for parameters
- Include `display` option for conditional rendering

### Frontend Development

**Stimulus Controllers:**

- Located in `app/javascript/controllers/`
- Follow Stimulus conventions with kebab-case names
- Use Stimulus actions for interactive components

**CSS/Styling:**

- Tailwind CSS with daisyUI components
- Follow utility-first approach
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**Assets:**

- Vite for asset bundling
- Images in `app/assets/images/`
- Use WebP format for optimized images

### Database & Models

**Schema Patterns:**

- Use `annotaterb` gem for model annotations
- SQLite database with proper indexing
- Use foreign key constraints
- Counter cache patterns: `counter_cache: :talks_count`

**Data Validation:**

- Validate presence of required fields
- Use Rails enum for status fields
- Normalize data with `normalizes` callback
- Encrypt sensitive data: `encrypts :email, deterministic: true`

**Associations:**

- Use `inverse_of` for bidirectional associations
- `strict_loading: false` where needed for performance
- Scoped associations: `has_many :approved_topics, -> { approved }`

### Background Jobs & Processing

**Job Patterns:**

- Use Solid Queue for background processing
- Jobs in `app/jobs/` directory
- Process video metadata, transcripts, AI summaries
- Handle external API calls asynchronously

**Queue Configuration:**

```ruby
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue
config.solid_queue.connects_to = {database: {writing: :queue}}
```

### Search & Data

**Data Structure:**

- Conference data stored in YAML files under `data/`
- Organizations, speakers, events, and videos defined in YAML
- Rake tasks process and import data

### Testing Standards

**Test Structure:**

- Use Minitest (not RSpec)
- Parallel test execution enabled
- VCR for API mocking
- Fixtures for test data
- System tests with Capybara + Selenium

**Test Patterns:**

```ruby
class TalkTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "creates slug from title" do
    talk = talks(:ruby_conf_talk)
    assert_equal "awesome-ruby-talk", talk.slug
  end

  test "belongs to event" do
    talk = talks(:ruby_conf_talk)
    assert_equal events(:ruby_conf_2023), talk.event
  end
end
```

**Test Helper Setup:**

- Search reindexing in setup
- Sign in helper: `sign_in_as(user)`
- VCR cassettes for external API calls

### API & Integrations

**External APIs:**

- YouTube API for video metadata
- GitHub API for user authentication
- OpenAI API for AI features
- All API clients in `app/clients/` directory

**AI Features:**

- Transcript enhancement
- Topic extraction
- Talk summarization
- All AI prompts stored in `app/models/prompts/`

### Development Commands

**Common Commands:**

- `bin/setup` - Full setup including Docker and database seeding
- `bin/dev` - Start Rails server, jobs, and Vite
- `bin/lint` - Run all linters and formatters
- `bin/rails test` - Run full test suite
- `bundle exec standardrb --fix` - Fix Ruby formatting
- `yarn format` - Fix JavaScript formatting

**Data Management:**

- `bin/rails db:seed` - Seed database from YAML files
- YAML files define conference structure and video metadata

### Deployment & Production

**Kamal Deployment:**

- Use Kamal for containerized deployment
- Dockerfile included for production builds
- Environment-specific configurations

**Monitoring:**

- AppSignal for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Ahoy for user analytics
- Mission Control for job monitoring

## Code Quality Standards

1. **Always run `standardrb --fix` for Ruby formatting**
2. **Use `yarn format` for JavaScript formatting**
3. **Include tests for new functionality**
4. **Follow Rails naming conventions**
5. **Use ViewComponents for reusable UI elements**
6. **Implement proper error handling**
7. **Add appropriate database indexes**
8. **Use background jobs for long-running tasks**
9. **Follow security best practices**
10. **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**

## Common Patterns to Follow

- Models use concerns for shared behavior
- Controllers are slim with business logic in models/services
- ViewComponents for reusable UI with design system consistency
- Background jobs for external API calls and heavy processing
- Proper caching strategies with Solid Cache
- SEO-friendly URLs with slugs
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Session-based authentication
- Comprehensive test coverage

When implementing features, always consider performance, security, accessibility, and maintainability. Follow Rails conventions and this project's established patterns.
