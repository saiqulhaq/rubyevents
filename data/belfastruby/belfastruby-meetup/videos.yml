    Time to update your diaries, as the December 2015 BelfastRuby (http://belfastruby.com/) meetup has now been confirmed! We have three great talks lined up, suited to both the aspiring and experienced Rubyists among us.

    Your unit tests may be working, but did you actually deliver that feature you promised? Let's take a step back, and test your web application as a whole - as the user would. Our first talk is presented by Alan Foster (http://www.alanfoster.me) who will discuss automated Capybara Feature Testing in Ruby.

    Following Alan, Andrew Carr (https://twitter.com/ac2u) will be giving a talk on alternative rails architectures.

    The third and final talk will be given by Lead ShopKeep (http://www.shopkeep.com/) Engineer Paul Guelpa. Paul will be specially visiting from the New York offices to impart his wisdom on how implementing ShopKeep's platform services in Go has taught him more about Ruby.

    With the next meetup being so close to the festivity of Christmas, let's start the celebrations with mulled wine and food.

    Be sure to watch this space for any updates!

    It's the new year, and BelfastRuby is back better than ever! The March 2016 meetup has two great beginner-friendly talks lined up. Be sure to not miss out!

    James Burns will be delivering a talk on mobile testing with Ruby and Appium. Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps. It drives iOS and Android apps using the WebDriver protocol.

    Our second talker Heather McNamee, from GitLab (https://about.gitlab.com/) will be showing us how to effectively use Git Version Control Workflow within your projects. Specifically delving into how you can use GitLab to create branches, changes, and merge pull requests - and what is happening behind the scenes within Git to make this all happen.

    Our final talker, David Kennedy of Shopkeep (http://www.shopkeep.com/) will present his beginner-friendly talk, "Ruby makes me happy". Where he will discuss the reasons why he loves Ruby, and what makes Ruby awesome!

    As always, the next meetup will have Beer, Soft Drinks, and Pizza! Come meet us at the Hub within Queen's University Belfast Student Guidance Center, to the left of the Student's Union

    Hi,

    In 2017 we want to reboot Belfast Ruby and have regular bi-monthly meetups again. This will take a group effort so please come along if you are interested.

    We have lined up a meetup (venue to be decided) on Tuesday the 28th of March 2017. We have three great talks lined up.

    Pete Hawkins

    Pete (https://twitter.com/peteyhawkins) of Dawson & Andrews (https://dawsonandrews.com/) will give a talk on rails 5 + webpack and how to enrich your project with a suite of rich client side features.

    David Schmitt

    David (https://puppet.com/blog/author/david-schmitt) of Puppet Labs will give an introductory talk on RSpec the behaviour driven development framework.

    Stephen McCullough

    Stephen (http://twitter.com/swmcc) of ShopKeep (http://www.shopkeep.com) will build a bot for Slack. The time allotted is 30mins. The aim for this talk is:

    • test driven

    • have a bot talking in the belfastruby slack room

    • pushed onto github so attendees can offer PRs in the form of bugfixes or enhancements later

    Hope to see you there,

    Stephen

    Belfast Ruby: The Reboot Meetup

    Hello, Ruby enthusiasts of Belfast!

    We're excited to invite you to a special kind of meetup, one without talks but plenty of conversation. We're calling it "Reboot", and the aim is simple: to have an open dialogue about what we want BelfastRuby to be, moving forward. We'd like to hear your thoughts, gauge interest in future talks, workshops, and events, and generally make plans to revive and rejuvenate our community.

    There will be pizza!
    Stora, a local Belfast-based startup, is generously sponsoring our next event! We're thrilled to announce that thanks to their support, we will not only have a great venue at FarsetLabs but also some delicious pizza to enjoy. Stora uses Ruby to drive their innovative business solutions, reflecting the spirit of our Belfast Ruby community. To learn more about them, check out their website at https://stora.co. A huge thank you to Stora for their help – their sponsorship is a perfect example of how local companies are playing a vital role in supporting and nurturing our community.

    Let's Set the Agenda Together
    If you have any ideas for the meetup or want to discuss potential topics, feel free to join the conversation on our Slack group, specifically the NI Tech #belfastruby channel.

    We're really looking forward to seeing you there and reimagining what BelfastRuby can become with your input. Let's reboot and build something amazing together!

    Best wishes,

    The BelfastRuby Team

    Belfast Ruby: The Campfire Code Review Meetup

    Location: FarsetLabs - Weavers Court - Belfast - BT12 5GH

    Sponsored by: SkillfulGorilla

    Hello, Ruby enthusiasts of Belfast!

    We're excited to invite you to a special kind of meetup, one without talks but plenty of conversation. It’s an attempt at a new kind of community led discussion around a piece of software. This time the special guest is 37signals "Campfire" (ONCE), and the aim is simple: to have an open dialogue about what the code base as we dive in together.

    Join us on this first (of hopefully many) explorations of Ruby source code.

    Suggestions welcone
    The plan is to do a little preparation ahead of time to pull some stats and charts etc from analysis tools and try and pull together a visualisation of how the whole thing works as we review it together properly for the first time. No spoilers.

    Let's Set the Agenda Together
    If you have any ideas for the meetup for tools you would like to see run against the code, please message @davidjrice on Twitter(x)

    We're really looking forward to seeing you there and prototyping a more collaborative style of event for BelfastRuby that could become something awesome with your input. Let's build something amazing together!

    Pizza and soft drinks
    Food will be provided by our sponsor - SkillfulGorilla - a local boutique software consultancy.

    Best wishes,

    The BelfastRuby Team
