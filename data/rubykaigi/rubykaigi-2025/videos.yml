    In modern computing, Unicode has become the go-to solution for most scenarios. However, challenges related to character encoding still exist and continue to evolve as we adapt to Unicode. By examining how Ruby handles updates to Unicode, this discussion explores the current issues surrounding character encoding.

    CRuby currently has two parsers, Prism and parse.y, and starting with Ruby 3.4, Prism has become the default parser. Prism is a new Ruby parser that claims to be highly compatible with the traditional parser, parse.y. But, how can we guarantee this compatibility? One formal (academic) solution to this problem is automata learning, an algorithm to infer an automata from a black-box system. Automata has some benefits, e.g., we can verify two automata are the same. Therefore, we can ensure that Prism and parse.y are the same if their automata obtained by automata learning are the same. In this talk, we provide an overview the automata theory and introduce an algorithm of automata learning called L*. We will also introduce the case study of how a compatibility issue in Prism was found using automata learning (ruby/prism#3035). We believe it will be an interesting talk as an application of the latest academic topics.

    Processes and fork management in Ruby have traditionally relied on PIDs, leading to race conditions and potential security issues in high-throughput systems. While Linux 5.3 introduced pidfd as a solution, Ruby lacks native support for this feature. I'll demonstrate how I bridged this gap using FFI, exploring syscall mappings, zombie process prevention, and practical process management patterns. Through live demonstrations, you'll learn how Linux pidfd APIs can help you eliminate race conditions and make your Ruby applications more reliable in modern environments.

    Type checking in Ruby often requires narrowing the types of objects, especially within complex conditionals or method chains. While Steep already supports type narrowing through built-in methods like #is_a? and #nil?, real-world Ruby applications frequently rely on user-defined logic for type narrowing.

    In this talk, I will propose "Type Guard," an enhancement to Steep that enables developers to define custom type narrowing logic. This feature aims to bridge the gap between Steep's capabilities and the diverse needs of real-world Ruby projects, providing a more seamless type-checking experience.

    Attendees will learn how Type Guard works, and how it can be integrated into their projects.

    The CRuby build system based on GNU Autotools has been evolving over the years, and it has been a critical part of the Ruby development process. However, the current build system has two major challenges: it's showing its age and is getting harder to edit and maintain without help from the expert, and `./configure && make` takes a long time even on a modern machine with many cores.

    In this talk, I will discuss the evolution of the CRuby build system, the challenges we face today, and the potential future directions. I will also introduce the new build system that I have been working on, which is inspired by the Shake build system.

    Despite the subtle relationship with interpreter implementations, first-class continuations still have unique functionality. In this talk, I will describe how "callcc"—a control flow operator which is provided in library "continuation"—plays an important role in the context of domain specific language through the "do syntax" of list monads. In addition, I also claim how "callcc" has some inconveniences—cutting unnecessarily wide program pieces, and resulting in degraded executing performances—and introduce its advanced form, delimited continuation operators can resolve many issues.

    Most existing Ruby stack profilers rely on the GVL, which blocks application execution and leads to high CPU usage.

    SDB, on the other hand, releases the GVL when scanning Ruby thread stacks. This design minimizes its impact on Ruby applications, allowing us to increase the sampling rate from 100/s to 1000/s while still consuming very low CPU. This makes SDB a truly always-online stack profiler.

    In this talk, I will explain how to implement a stack profiler without relying on the GVL, along with its benefits and challenges.

    One of Ruby's most powerful features is the ability to extend the language itself through meta-programming. We can create rich and elegant DSLs that allow developers to solve problems with flexible and concise code.

    The drawback of DSLs is that they are difficult to analyze statically, reducing the usefulness of developer tooling like editor integrations. Since each gem can define their own DSL, we cannot account for all possible DSLs that may exist in a given application. So what can we do?

    Let's do a deep dive into the Ruby LSP's add-on API, which allows any other gem to enhance the static analysis understanding of the language server for a more accurate editor experience. We'll explore the techniques behind it and which class of problems it can solve.

    In this talk, we will share the fascinating journey of the Zendesk Indexer, a microservice responsible for indexing tens of thousands of records per second from a relational database into ElasticSearch. Originally born from a need to speed up record updates, the Indexer evolved from a series of scripts written in C-Ruby into a full application built in JRuby. Over the years, it incorporated diverse technologies like Riak and S3 and tackled significant challenges, particularly with concurrency, as Zendesk scaled. Now, we are preparing to reintegrate it into the Rails monolith. Attendees will learn valuable lessons about concurrency, safety mechanisms and scaling.

    In my presentation, I will show how data-flow programming can be used for software development of small devices. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a microcontroller implementation in mruby/c.

    In IoT programming, we want to focus on the flow of data generation and processing. This is data flow programming, also known as the Node-RED development environment.

    Data flow is processed asynchronously. I will explain how to implement this asynchronous processing in a reasonable manner using mruby/c and demonstrate its operation on a real microcontroller.

    SQLite's popularity is on the rise, and likewise the ecosystem of tools around it is growing. Unfortunately, SQLite does not expose its parser for 3rd parties to use independently. This greatly limits the ability of developers to build tools that must interact with SQLite's SQL dialect. And so, I have hand-written a 100% Ruby, 100% compatible parser for SQLite's SQL dialect. In addition, having a complete AST permits us to also generate SQL queries from terse, structured Ruby code. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we ensure that the parser is 100% compatible with SQLite's SQL dialect. We will also explore how the parser is implemented and what kind of AST it produces. Then, we will dive into how to use the parser to build tools that can analyze and manipulate SQL queries. Finally, we will look at how to use the generator to build tools that can generate SQL queries programmatically. As Ruby's only full SQLite SQL parser, this library opens up a world of possibilities for developers.

    Ruby isn't just for the Web. Did you know you can create music with it too?

    In this talk, I will demonstrate how groovebox-ruby was built from scratch as a functional groovebox using Ruby. What is a groovebox? It's a machine for sketching musical ideas, equipped with tools like synthesizers, step sequencers, filters, samplers, and interactive controls such as buttons, knobs, and displays.

    With groovebox-ruby, I began by implementing synthesizer basics like VCOs (Voltage Controlled Oscillators) and VCFs (Voltage Controlled Filters) to understand how these components shape sound. I then added a step sequencer, allowing users to program patterns and interact dynamically with MIDI inputs.

    Reimplementing these features in Ruby deepened my understanding of synthesizers, particularly the roles of oscillators and filters. Ruby's extensibility also enabled modular design, such as chaining filters, using MIDI controllers, and building a distributed step sequencer with dRuby.

    PicoRuby's VM is mruby/c. While it has the advantage of being memory-saving, it also has disadvantages such as a lack of Ruby language specifications and the inability to call Ruby methods from C.

    By integrating the mruby VM into PicoRuby's features of memory-saving runtime compilation and a practical development ecosystem, MicroRuby brings ISO/IEC 30170-compliant Ruby to microcontroller programming and expands the scope of application development. In this session, I will provide a detailed explanation of the technical barriers that this project has overcome.

    RuboCop has long faced issues with a lack of modularity and is now encountering new challenges due to changes in the parser engine.

    There has been extensive development of custom cop extension gems, but these extension methods have relied on RuboCop's implementation for a long time. RuboCop is widely used behind the scenes in the Ruby ecosystem. For example, the backends of Ruby LSP and Standard Ruby utilize RuboCop's engine. However, the division of responsibilities with these tools has been insufficient. The introduction of the plugin system using lint_roller and the Ruby LSP add-on aim to resolve these issues. I will discuss the adoption and availability of integrating these into RuboCop.

    Another major issue is the maintenance status of the Parser gem, which has long been RuboCop's backend parser. I will talk about RuboCop's future backend strategy based on Prism.

    You will gain insights into new methods of extending RuboCop and the upcoming changes in the near future.

    I introduced Happy Eyeballs Version 2 (RFC8305) (hereafter HEv2) into the socket library's `Socket.tcp` and `TCPSocket.new`. This algorithm addresses the issue of delays that occur when DNS resolution for one address family takes too long, or when one of the candidate IP addresses is unavailable, preventing fallback to other options.

    At RubyKaigi 2024, I presented how HEv2 was implemented in `Socket.tcp` (written in Ruby). And I initially planned to apply the same approach to `TCPSocket.new` (written in C). However, things did not go as expected, and the work began with reimplementing `Socket.tcp` itself.

    This was a deeply rewarding project—so much so that it turned me, a Rubyist with an interest in networking, into a Ruby committer.

    In this presentation, I will revisit HEv2, particularly focusing on `TCPSocket.new`, and share the journey of how it was implemented, merged, and eventually released as part of Ruby 3.4.

    Learn how we migrated RBS to remove its dependency on the Ruby VM and expose a new C API. In addition to being faster and more memory-efficient, it's now more portable: tools like Prism, Sorbet, JRuby and TruffleRuby will be able to use RBS directly. Type checkers like Steep and Sorbet will now be able to parse multiple RBS files in parallel, unconstrained by the GVL.

    The Ruby VM offers many luxuries that can help ease C extension development, such as garbage collection, exceptions, and the many built-in data structures like `Array` and `Hash`. Unfortunately, to be maximally portable and multi-threaded, some C extensions like RBS and Prism will need to forego these conveniences. We'll show techniques for replicating them in pure C.

    Join us to explore advanced techniques in writing C extensions and see how this universal RBS parser paves the way for improved tooling and collaboration in the Ruby ecosystem.

        When developing a new programming language, it is typically necessary to implement both a frontend (such as a parser) and a backend (such as a virtual machine). However, especially during the prototyping stage, if the primary novelty of the language lies in its backend, it is desirable to simplify frontend implementation as much as possible. This presentation introduces an approach that leverages Ruby's powerful metaprogramming capabilities to construct language frontends with minimal effort. Specifically, we discuss an intuitive method of generating intermediate representations (such as SSA forms) directly from Ruby scripts written in a natural syntax.

        As concerns about privacy and security in DNS resolution grow, encrypted protocols such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) have emerged. In this talk, I will introduce a Ruby implementation of a DDR (Discovery of Designated Resolvers) client, which enables the distribution of information about secure and encrypted DNS resolvers like DoH. While DDR allows multiple DNS resolvers to be advertised, verifying whether each resolver is functioning correctly can be challenging. To address this, I developed a debugging tool as a Ruby gem to confirm whether DDR is operating as expected.

        Additionally, this talk will cover how this gem was used to troubleshoot issues encountered when deploying DDR in the DNS service provided for exhibitors and visitors at Interop Tokyo 2024's ShowNet.

        In an effort to build a general-purpose parallel request client in Ruby—something anyone in our team could easily use—I ran into an unexpected roadblock: the limitations of the Fiber Scheduler. This talk walks through the journey from parallelizing Faraday requests, to exploring Fiber Scheduler as a lightweight alternative to threads, and ultimately hitting a wall when trying to support gRPC and AWS SDK. I'll explain why Fiber Scheduler couldn't handle gRPC due to its C-level implementation, and how that led to a shift toward using threads instead. If you're curious about the real-world limitations of Ruby's Fiber Scheduler and what it takes to design a truly flexible parallel request client, this talk is for you.

        There are many wonderful synthesizers and electronic instruments in the world. And instruments and devices that support MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) can easily be played together.

        I am making a simple MIDI controller device PRMC-1 for use in electronic music performances using PicoRuby/R2P2 (Ruby Rapid Portable Platform). I can adjust the synthesizer parameters by turning the knobs, or play chords as arpeggios with the sequencer function. The hardware is made with Raspberry Pi Pico, M5Stack Unit 8Angle and Unit MIDI, and no soldering.

        All code is written in Ruby! Would you like to create your own musical device using Ruby?

    Steep provides documentation features integrated with editors. You can read Ruby code with documentations of classes and methods, which hovers near the cursor. You can write Ruby code with completion suggestions with documentation, helping you select the best option from the list.

    The feature can be seen as a variant of traditional documentation tools, like RDoc and YARD. However, it is essentially different from other tools: instead of generating human-readable files, it provides an API. The API provides a data structure that allows retrieving the documentation associated with each component of Ruby programs.

    In this talk, I will outline the implementation, discuss the requirements, and share design considerations behind the feature.

    monoruby is a new Ruby implementation I am working on, written in Rust, built from scratch, and consisting of a parser, interpreter, garbage collector, and just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Since the last RubyKaigi, I have made progress in Rubygems support and other performance improvements. This time I want to present the details of the optimizations and the various features for performance tuning. Meaningful optimization requires measurement and evaluation, so I have implemented features to record where and why various events such as JIT compilation, JIT code invalidation, and deoptimization (back to the interpreter) occurred, and to display the generated assembly for each virtual machine instruction. The actual optimizations implemented in monoruby include machine code inlining, method inlining, polymorphic method call optimization, faster instance variable access, faster array access, etc. Making the Ruby compiler is fun.

    I want to introduce a Ruby one-binary conversion tool. I am developing a gem called Kompo. Kompo was developed to make one-binary Ruby game engines, which I can develop in Ruby as a hobby. Kompo is based on the concept of "easy to run anywhere reasonably fast." Now, a simple program with Sinatra + SQLite can be made one binary. However, Kompo cannot include anything besides Ruby scripts in the binary because it achieves one binary by overriding `require,` which is sufficient. If you want to make a Ruby on Rails app one-binary, you need to include YAML, etc., in the binary and also be able to read it via `IO.read`, etc. So, I have provided Kompo with a means for users to access binary data freely. This allows you to read the YAML files in the binary using `IO.read`, etc. In this session, I will describe the details of this implementation and demonstrate how Ruby can be run as one binary.

    Garbage collection (GC) is a big challenge in multi-Ractor systems. In the current implementation, all Ractors share a global heap, and GC requires stopping all Ractors to perform GC. This approach negatively impacts object allocation and GC performance.

    Ideally, GC should be executed in parallel for each Ractor's local heap. However, shareable objects make it difficult to track references and implement fully parallel GC.

    To address this, we propose Ractor-local GC, which focuses on collecting non-shareable, Ractor-local objects in parallel, while continuing to perform global GC for shareable objects by pausing all Ractors, as in the current system. This hybrid approach allows most GC operations to run in parallel, improving overall performance. Furthermore, since shareable objects are expected to be relatively few compared to non-shareable objects, the frequency of global GC should remain low.

    This talk will present the design of Ractor-local GC and the progress of its implementation.

    We'll discuss the improvements we made to the `ruby/rbs` parser, which can now function without the need for the RubyVM. This enhancement not only makes it compatible with Sorbet but also opens the door for use from other C/C++/Rust tools.

    We'll also showcase our tool to automatically convert Sorbet RBI signatures into RBS comments, addressing some of the differences and challenges between the two syntaxes.

    PicoRuby is a very small implementation of Ruby designed to run on microcontrollers. It is an outstanding open-source project that has already been proven to work on well-known microcontroller boards such as the Raspberry Pi Pico. Moreover, it is thoughtfully designed to facilitate operation on other microcontrollers.

    In my project, I worked on porting PicoRuby to the ESP32, a low-cost and low-power microcontroller module developed by Espressif Systems. The ESP32 supports wireless communication such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, making it an excellent match for developing IoT (Internet of Things) systems.

    The process of adapting PicoRuby to different microcontrollers involved continuous hypothesis testing. It required writing build configurations tailored to the specific microcontroller and developing dedicated C source code for it.

    In this presentation, I will introduce the approaches I took and invite you into the deep and fascinating world of embedded systems.

    Sigstore Ruby now exists. So exciting! But bringing it to life was a challenge, particularly due to the goal of being able to ship it as a part of Ruby itself. Building a sigstore implementation atop only the standard library required writing a TUF client, implementing custom x509 handling, and abstracting over all the supported key types, among other challenges. This talk will explore those challenges, and dive into _why_ a sigstore implementation proves to be such an undertaking, hopefully inspiring some simplification for the next poor soul who attempts to build one from scratch.

    This talk is for both library authors and their users - showing how to make method deprecations more manageable through automated code analysis and transformation suggestions. While Ruby's ecosystem has various ways to handle method deprecations, the process of updating deprecated code often remains manual and time-consuming.

    What if the world were like this? Library authors would only need to define conversion rules for deprecated methods. Client developers would get patches that they could apply immediately to resolve deprecations by simply running their existing programs. In this talk, I will show how my own tool, Deprewriter, makes this possible. I'll introduce how to analyze deprecated method calls at runtime and suggest code transformations with Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities.

    Through this presentation, I'll explore how Ruby's flexibility can be leveraged to create tools that make deprecation handling more systematic and developer-friendly.
