    Vienna.rb is back! Are you interested in the Ruby language or Ruby on Rails? Join us. We have great talks, good vibes, and cookies! 🍪

    Talks
    ~~~~~

    🗣️ Grzegorz Jakubiak
    ▶️ Refine Your Monkey Patch
    🗒️ A practical guide to monkey patching without introducing unexpected bugs. Learn techniques to safely extend your code without unwanted side effects, using Ruby’s refinement feature—a tool Matz has labeled a failure. This talk will equip you with best practices for patching responsibly.

    🗣️ Thomas Leitner
    ▶️ 10 Years of HexaPDF
    🗒️ A look at how HexaPDF came to be, from idea to running a business. The journey was (and still is) filled with challenges, happy moments and things one should -in hindsight - definitely not do! 🙂 The talk is light on the technical side of HexaPDF and focuses more on the things I did and learned.

    🗣️ Nicolas Dular
    ▶️ An Epic Migration
    🗒️ Join me on our epic adventure of migrating GitLab epics! In this talk, I'll dive into the challenges of executing zero-downtime migrations at scale, why we opted for bi-directional syncing (and the struggles that came with it), and how we coordinated the project. Come for the tech insights, and stay for the stories of how we tracked down out-of-sync data!

    It's the Vienna.rb spring edition! 🌸 Are you interested in the Ruby language or Ruby on Rails? Join us. We have great talks, good vibes, and yummy snacks! 😋

    We have something special this time: Lightning Talks! ⚡

    Lightning talks are limited to 10 minutes and are an excellent opportunity for first-time speakers to try their hand at public speaking. Check it out!

    Talks & Lightning Talks
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    🗣️ Jan Grodowski
    ▶️ Balancing Quality and Speed of Testing with the Undercover Gem
    🗒️ We'll take a look at Ruby test coverage strategies and the variables that come into play when preventing faults in our software products. We'll discuss what makes tests good, what to test versus not to and when is the right time to do it. I'll introduce the undercover Ruby gem and additionally share a few stories about turning this idea and gem into a side hustle.

    ⚡ Seth Horsley
    ▶️ Building Beautiful UIs with ruby: A Rails-native Approach
    🗒️ Tired of slow ERB templates and messy view logic? Discover how Phlex and RubyUI bring blazing-fast (12x!) and beautiful components to Rails while maintaining the Ruby way we all love. Let's see how we can build modern, accessible UIs without leaving the Rails ecosystem!

    ⚡ Anton Bangratz
    ▶️ Jujutsu: Will it replace Git?
    🗒️ Jujutsu is a DVCS, or "distributed version control system". You are probably familiar with the biggest of those systems: Git. Jujutsiy is said to be easier and simpler than Git while being even more powerful. In this talk we'll find out if that's true!

    ⚡ Johannes Daxböck
    ▶️ Logical, Mr Matz: A Foray into Logic Programming in Ruby
    🗒️ Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative/procedural styles. However, it is rarely associated with logic programming. In this talk, I'll explore the concepts and applications of logic programming through its most prominent language, Prolog, and compare them to Ruby. We'll also dive into some Ruby archaeology, uncovering existing Ruby-based logic programming libraries.
