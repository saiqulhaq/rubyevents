    We've all found ourselves in situations where we had to evaluate very quickly what the quality was of a Rails codebase.  In some cases it's to evaluate an acquisition, in other cases to put an estimate on maintenance and evolution of an existing application.
    My talk will describe how to smell out,in one day, hour by hour, whether there are any pain points,and where they are.

We've been doing Agile for over 10 years, and Rails for over 4. We've delivered over 80 Rails apps to customers, and have learned a thing or two about how to do that sustainably and well.

    SQL databases are awesome at certain problems. But most Rails apps encounter data challenges that make traditional databases look seriously puny. So...is SQL over? In this talk, we'll dig into the guts of the relational model, look at the problems SQL doesn't solve well, and - crucially - understand why. Then we'll answer the million-dollar question: is NoSQL the only alternative?

    Most people think that freedom engenders creativity, but the opposite is true. But too much constraint makes it hard to get stuff done. It turns out that you need just enough constraint, and figuring out what gives you that perfect level is harder than you think. This keynote investigates the relationship between creativity and constraint as it applies to software development in the modern world.

    With such a vibrant and emerging economy of new persistence options for web applications it can be diffcult to know when and how to use them in your applications. Worse yet, you don't want to lose mountains of existing infrastructure and support for RDBMS systems in Rails. What's a developer to do? Blend it! Learn new techniques for using multiple persistence engines in a single application.

    This workshop will tour through a number of advanced, in-depth topics on Rails 3. We'll look take a tour of many of the new additions to Rails 3, talk about how to exploit Rails' new focus on Rack to your advantage, dig around in the source to really understand how many of the pieces work, and take a look at how to bring some common, advanced patterns used in Rails 2.x into the world of Rails 3.

    ActiveRelation and ActiveModel bring a lot of interesting features to
    Rails 3. These new libraries make it easier to write complex queries
    and to extend Rails to work with non-ActiveRecord objects. Learn to
    use ActiveRelation and ActiveModel to clean up your code. See how you
    can use ARel and AMo to build your own data layer or to connect to new
    datastores.

    Software engineering as it's taught in universities simply doesn't work.  It doesn't
    produce software systems of high quality, and it doesn't produce them for low cost.
    Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, it doesn't produce systems at all.

    That's odd, because in every other field, the term "engineering" is reserved for
    methods that work.

    Tools like Cucumber encourage driving new pieces of functionality through tests which cut through the entire Rails web stack, including the database. As a consequence these Acceptance tests can be quite slow. This leaves us in a dichotomy, you want to keep adding new features to your product and you want to maintain rapid test feedback. Somethings got to give. So how do we scale Acceptance tests?

    Burgers made from? We're going to take a look inside the bun to discover
    what makes up Rails, how the software gets to our plate, and how we can
    improve it. We'll discuss some of the lower level libraries used to make up
    Rails, and what makes them tick. Better Ingredients, Better Burgers.
    Guaranteed.

    We'd mastered it all: join tables, polymorphic associations, nested sets, all neatly normalized. Then we awoke to the haze of NoSQL, where the data-modeling rules had changed. This presentation attempts to correct that by exploring document-oriented modeling with MongoDB. We'll cover common design patterns and contrast strategies for modeling product data in an RDBMS and a document store.

    Up till now, computer hardware technology has been advancing by orders of magnitude every year; has software technology been keeping up?  Now that headlong advance of hardware shows signs of slowing.  Moore's law may be dead.  Does that mean that software technology will have to pick up the slack?  Can it?  Is Ruby/Rails a hint of the future solution?  If not, what is?
