  speakers:
    - Mike Dalessio
  description: |-
    As Rails's SQLite support has improved, it's finally possible to have truly multi-tenant Rails applications - isolated data for each account! - without sacrificing performance or ease of use. This talk describes a novel, production-vetted approach to isolating tenant data everywhere in Rails: the database, fragment caches, background jobs, Active Storage, Turbo Stream broadcasts, Action Mailer, and even the testing framework.

    You'll learn how to build a new multi-tenant app or migrate an existing one. You'll learn the technical details of how Rails can support multiple tenants and strict data isolation. You'll see a live demonstration of a multi-tenant app. And you'll learn why a deployment topology like this might make sense for you, and how it scales up and out.

  speakers:
    - Kevin McConnell
  description: |-
    SQLite is an increasingly popular choice for powering Rails applications. It's fast, simple to use, and has an impressive feature set. But without a conventional database server, scaling beyond a single application server can be challenging.

    Beamer is a lightweight replication tool for SQLite, designed to make it easy to add read-only replicas to your writable databases. In this talk, we'll cover how Beamer works and how you can use it to build multi-server, geographically distributed SQLite-based Rails applications.

    At Procore, our Rails monolith is massive - among the largest in the world - and intimidating to newcomers. I designed and taught a course that helped over 900 engineers of varying skill levels stop fearing it by teaching Rails and our monolith at the same time. Rather than using generic tutorials, we grounded everything in the actual product they'd be working on - layering Rails fundamentals with the domain-specific knowledge they really needed. In this talk, I'll share how learning science, product context, and deep app knowledge came together to make our course work—and how you can adapt it for your team.

  speakers:
    - Donal McBreen
  description: |-
    Long-running jobs can cause problems. They can delay deployments and leave old versions of your code running longer than expected. Interrupting them can leave data in an inconsistent state or cause redundant rework.

    Active Job Continuations let you define multi-step workflows or checkpoint iterations to track your progress, and they're easy to integrate with your existing jobs. From there, they handle interrupting and resuming jobs across application restarts.

    We built Active Job Continuations at 37signals to make Basecamp's jobs container-friendly for deploying with Kamal. Come to this talk to learn more about how it works.

  speakers:
    - Adrianna Chang
  description: |-
    Events in Rails applications are like the heartbeat of your code - whether it's a log, a telemetry signal, or a business event, they tell us when something interesting is happening. To truly harness he power of these events for observability and data analysis, we need high-quality, contextualized data. The human-readable lines that Rails.logger provides is great for manual inspection but falls short in production and analytics contexts.

    At Shopify, we recognized the need for a unified approach to events. After years of managing various in-house solutions for structured logging, we built support for structured events into the Rails framework itself. This talk will unveil the Structured Event Reporter, Rails' new approach to structured events, and showcase how we're using it to power events in our monolith.

  description: |-
    Databases crash, connections drop, and queries timeout at the worst possible moments. Rather than writing custom rescue code everywhere, Rails is revolutionizing how Active Record handles these inevitable hiccups.

    This technical deep dive explores key improvements in connection management, error handling, and recovery strategies introduced in Rails 7 and optimized in Rails 8. You'll learn how Active Record intelligently manages connection pools and retries failed queries.

    Whether you're running a massive production app or building a new side project, you'll walk away knowing how to leverage these features to build applications that bend instead of break when database chaos strikes.

- title: "Ruby Stability at Scale"
  speakers:
    - Peter Zhu
  description: |-
    There are many talks, articles, and tutorials on how to monitor your Rails app for stability. These assume the source of the bug comes from your application code, from Rails itself, or from a gem. But what if the source of instability comes from Ruby or a native gem? If Ruby crashes, do you have any monitoring or ways to debug it?

    In this talk, we'll look at how we deal with Ruby crashes in the Shopify monolith, the world's largest Ruby on Rails application, and how you can use some of our techniques. We'll cover topics such as how we monitor crashes, capture core dumps for debugging, prevent crashes, and minimize the impact of crashes on production.

- title: "Rails Under a Microscope: Diagnosing Slowness at the Byte Level"
  speakers:
    - Snehal Ahire
  description: |-
    We realized our legacy code didn't need a rewrite, it needed a performance plan.

    This talk shares how we tackled real production issues like memory bloat, slow queries, and Sidekiq queues piling up under load, where simple fixes like batching jobs or tweaking retries didn't help much.

    We thought Active Record was the bottleneck, but fixing it only scratched the surface. We optimised query access patterns, chose more efficient data structures, restructured background jobs, and introduced smarter database caching and indexing strategies.

    I'll share how we analysed query plans, fine-tuned database performance, and replaced slow, fragile logic with leaner, more explicit code paths that scaled better and failed less while Rails stayed right at the center of it all.

  speakers:
    - Paweł Strzałkowski
  description: |-
    Remember the joy of Rails scaffold creating web interfaces in DHH's demos? Let's make it just as simple for AI integrations!

    Imagine Rails scaffolding not just views for humans, but a parallel, AI interaction layer - out of the box!

    How? By embracing convention over configuration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the emerging standard (backed by Google & OpenAI) for AI-app interactions.
    Example: Scaffold a ReservationsController and instantly let an AI agent book a room via MCP - just like agents may use it with GitHub or JIRA today.

    I'll show:
    - A full-stack AI-ready app scaffolded live
    - An AI agent using it
    - How backend, frontend, and AI layers cooperate
    - How to make your app speak AI natively

    Ultimately, this talk shows Rails' competitive advantage for the AI era.

    Back in 2024, many of us in the Rails community dismissed passkeys as hype rather than a real password replacement. But now we're facing a serious problem - a newer and more sophisticated attack called Real-Time Phishing is gaining popularity and effortlessly defeating nearly all popular 2FA methods, except one: passkeys. Even security experts are getting fooled, and AI makes these attacks frighteningly scalable. In this session, I'll demo exactly how attackers execute real-time phishing live. Then we'll turn the tables: I'll guide you step-by-step through adding secure, user-friendly passkey authentication as an MFA option to your Rails 8 apps. Come on, Rails!

  speakers:
    - Radan Skorić
  description: |-
    Is Hotwire just for `rails new` scenarios and not worth it for mature applications? Absolutely not.

    I share my learnings from leading a migration of Halalbooking.com, a large hotel booking website, from a mix of technologies centered on React to Hotwire.

    Even though we couldn't enable Turbo Drive, we got a huge DX and performance boost from using other parts of Hotwire, making the migration more than worth it.

    I'll share specific examples and lessons learned along the way. You'll leave optimistic about introducing Hotwire to a mature codebase.

    As a bonus, you'll see:
    - When it's beneficial
    - How fast it pays back
    - How to introduce it gradually
    - Two concrete examples of complex Hotwire UIs
