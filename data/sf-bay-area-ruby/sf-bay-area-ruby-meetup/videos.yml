    YC is co-hosting a Ruby Meetup with Evil Martians to bring together fellow rubyists at YC’s new San Francisco HQ!

    We’ll have tech talks from YC founders sharing their novel uses of Ruby in the wild — and how it’s not the Ruby you tried 10+ years ago. Speakers so far:

    * Jared Friedman (YC Group Partner & Scribd, S06) will give an opening talk about the history of software at YC: how we chose Rails, who wrote the first MR to our codebase , why Bookface is a YC founder’s secret weapon, and how Rails powers everything from apps to Work at a Startup.
    * Daniel Farina (Ubicloud, W24) has been building infrastructure control planes in Ruby for 13 years - first at Heroku and now at Ubicloud. Daniel will detail his long and unusual journey with Ruby, and share his five favorite “features” that make Ruby particularly powerful for building infrastructure code.
    * Kelsey Pedersen (Capsule, S22) built Capsule on a V1 vector database with Rails, Postgres and Active Record with the PGVector plugin. She’s happy to share learnings at pitfalls, as well as how she uses webhooks and rakes to automate workflows and help keep the team small.
    * Keith Schacht (Mystery.org, S17) started coding Ruby in ‘05, and is still at it — building ChatGPT in Rails (vs Python) and keeping up with stimulus, new morphing, and Turbo Native. He’ll do some live coding of these new features, and wants to hear what you think!

    Also note: many of the companies presenting are hiring — including Y Combinator’s Software Team looking to hire a few Rails-guru too!

    If you’re interested, please apply to attend us for talks, dinner and refreshments — we have limited capacity, and we’ll try to get as many people in the doors as we can.

    ​​Hey, Bay Area builders and tinkerers!

    While Ruby may not dominate the headlines, it's the silent force behind the Bay Area's most successful startups. From GitHub and Stripe to Chime and Stackblitz, Ruby powers teams that go HUGE with less.

    ​Join us as we re-kindle the SF Ruby community's flame! It is a unique place to meet authors of your favorite open-source tools (or members of the Ruby core team), incredibly experienced engineers and new converts, as well as new startup founders building and experimenting with the power of Ruby and Rails. It's a chance to meet every month and make new Ruby friends.

    Our meetups explore Rails at scale, practical Hotwire implementations, methods for building AI-native apps and so much more—all through Ruby's uniquely productive lens.

    For our November gathering, Academia.edu is our gracious host! This time, the speaker lineup is unmatched: Jeremy Evans, author of "Polished Ruby," Sequel, and Roda, is joined by Konstantin Gredeskoul (Academia), Chris Fung (Binti), and Brad Gessler (Rocketship, Fly).

        Brad Gessler (Rocketship, Fly) "Content management in Rails with Sitepress.cc"

        This talk dives into https://sitepress.cc, a tool for integrating content management directly into Rails applications. Originally conceived to combine the power of static site generators like Middleman with Rails’ flexibility, Sitepress simplifies building and managing content-heavy websites. It’s designed to work as a standalone static site generator, a Rails engine, or a dynamic server.

        During the talk, we explore how the developer documentation at https://terminalwire.com use Sitepress’s advanced features, such as using markdown for pages, frontmatter for metadata, and traversing content with powerful tools like globbing and page models. A live demo showcased how these features come together to create polished documentation sites for developers.

        Lammy is a simple LLM library for Ruby. It doesn't treat prompts as just strings. They represent the entire code that generates the strings sent to a LLM. The abstraction also makes it easy to attach these methods directly to models, avoiding the need for boilerplate service code.

    Hey, Bay Area builders and tinkerers!

    This time we are hosted by Cisco Meraki and sponsored by Gusto! We are quickly crafting the agenda now, and it's going to be amazing thanks to all of you.

    🎙️ Submit a talk proposal here: https://forms.gle/C9HQzaT5jvwA5xwc7

    Ruby is the quiet force behind the Bay Area's most successful tech organizations and startups from GitHub, Shopify and Stripe to Figma, Chime, and bolt.new.

    We are gathering every month to learn, share, inspire each other, and it feels great because of MINASWAN 💗.

    Our meetups explore building and scaling Ruby and Rails applications. We go deep into technical topics and don't shy away from new ideas and weird experiments! We always have an open mic for everyone's announcements or questions🎙️! Join us in discovering the nicest Ruby HQs 🏙️❤️

    Catch you on the flip side! A massive shoutout to Cisco Meraki for hosting!

    Agenda:

    Fito von Zastrow & Alan Ridlehoover (Cisco Meraki): Derailing Our Application: How and Why We Are Decoupling Ourselves from Rails
    Obie Fernandez (Shopify): Structured AI Workflows at Scale with Roast
    Todd Kummer (Rockridge Solutions): Deploying a hobby project on Rails 8 and Kamal
    Victoria Melnikova (Evil Martians): Ruby events not to miss in 2025
    Brandon Weaver (One Medical): Red in Fantasyland

    Brought to you by Evil Martians.

    P.S. The video from the last meetup is up on our RubyEvents page, as usual:

    ​Address: 123 S Park St

    ​Hey, Bay Area builders and tinkerers,

    This is a special edition of the SF Ruby x Elixir that we host while José Valim is in town. José is the author of Elixir, a member of core Ruby and Rails teams in the past, a brilliant and inspiring speaker, and now the founder of Tidewave.ai!

    The main item on the agenda is the talk from José, but we will certainly have our classic open mic, and perhaps something else. Join us, it's going to be cool!

    A massive shoutout to PlanetScale for hosting.
    Brought to you by Evil Martians.

        José Valim, author of Elixir programming language, happened to be in San Francisco in June, and we organized a quick meetup, bringing together Elixir and Ruby meetups. Huge shoutout to PlanetScale for hosting.

        José talked about his new product, Tidewave.ai, an AI-powered coding assistant built for server-centric frameworks–Elixir, Rails, and Django (coming soon!), and his vision for the space and the work of a software engineer.

    We are thrilled to announce a community-driven Ruby AI Hackathon on Saturday, July 19, 2025 at the Sentry office in San Francisco! 🎉 Hosted by the SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup, this one-day hackathon is open to Ruby engineers of all kinds from the SF area. Details:

    * ​When: Saturday, July 19, 2025, 10:00 am to 5:30 pm
    * ​Where: Sentry HQ – 45 Fremont St, San Francisco, CA
    * ​Host: SF Bay Area Ruby Meetup
    * ​Who: Open to all Rubyists & friends in the Bay Area at any experience level
    * ​Teams: Solo or teams up to 3 people – your choice
    * ​Entry fee: None!
    * ​Food: lunch brought to you by Sentry
    * ​Prizes: $1,500 for the best team; $1,000 for the 2nd best team; $500 for the third best team


    # Rails as the one-person framework

    ​AI-assisted coding has exploded onto the scene, promising to amplify what solo devs can do. Ruby on Rails is the perfect partner for this approach. Rails has long been known as the one-person framework, a powerful toolkit designed to give lone developers and small teams superpowers, compressing the time and knowledge needed to ship big features

    ​This Ruby AI hackathon is about exploring that vision: how AI can make building a Rails app even more of a one-person show! Some participants might even experiment with voice coding setups – it’s all about exploring new ways to build with Ruby.


    # ​Current plans

    ​You can work solo as part of a small team. Bring your own application idea to life or choose from several project prompts we’ll provide if you need inspiration. Throughout the day, mentors will be on hand to help with technical issues, brainstorm AI solutions, or just cheer you on. We’re working on bringing special guests from the Ruby AI community joining as mentors and judges.

    ​As an all-day event, we’ll have breaks for lunch and snacks. At the end of the day, each individual or team will get to demo their app and briefly show off their code. A panel of judges will evaluate each project and provide encouraging feedback. They’ll be looking at creativity, use of the theme, and technical achievement given the time constraints.

    ​# Ready to hack? RSVP now!

    ​Sounds exciting? We sure hope so! RSVP on our Meetup page here so we can get a headcount. If you have any questions, feel free to drop by our Ruby SF Slack channel. Otherwise, just bring your laptop on July 19 and get ready to code with vibes.


    # ​Brought to you by

    ​The $3,000 prize pool is sponsored by Continue, Evil Martians, and Fly.io. Big thanks to our sponsors for making this event possible.
