    If you've ever felt overwhelmed by how much there is to learn in software—or frustrated that something just isn't clicking—this talk is for you. In 40 minutes, I'll share a practical framework for learning how to learn, developed through years of hands-on coding, mentoring, and formal teaching. You'll walk away with a set of ideas and practices to help you get better at getting better—no matter where you are in your career.

    Software development is more than just coding: it's really about how to solve problems that appear in a variety of shapes and forms.

    We'll start with a quick tour of 10 core learning principles, like "Context is Everything," "Spike to Learn, Build to Remember," and "The Spiral Staircase." These aren't buzzwords—they're mental models that help you tackle unfamiliar codebases, debug faster, and retain what you study. Think of it as a way to organize your learning, so you spend less time spinning your wheels and more time leveling up.

    Then we'll dig into a few specific practices you can try right away—like "Tiny Steps" to reduce cognitive load and build confidence, or "Broken Code Puzzles" to sharpen your skills through play and failure. These techniques are lightweight but powerful, and they work whether you're self-teaching a new gem or mentoring someone else.

    This won't be a lecture on neuroscience nor a random grab-bag of tips. It's a coherent framework of ideas and examples that will help you learn more efficiently, stay curious, and grow sustainably in a field that never stops changing. You'll leave with both high-level insight and concrete tools you can use immediately.

    Especially at a time where AI clickbait can cause fear and uncertainty, this talk will instill confidence we remain in control of our own destiny as professional developers.

    There was a time when Ruby felt like magic. It gave an entire generation of developers wings; tools to ship fast, dream big, and start companies from anywhere. It wasn't just code; it was a movement built on empathy, simplicity, and joy. Ruby taught us that developer happiness wasn't a luxury; it was a revolution.

    Now, a new kind of magic is emerging: AI. It's promising, powerful, and most importantly it's perilous. As the world rushes to automate, optimize, and amplify, we in the Ruby community have a chance to pause and ask better questions—not just *can we*, but *should we*?

    This talk isn't a demo reel. It's a conversation about responsibility, creativity, and care. About how we bring our whole selves to this moment, with wonder and with skepticism. We'll reflect on what AI means not just for our tools, but for our teams, our values, and the future we're quietly writing together.

    Ruby taught us to be kind and to focus on people over technology, and that lesson is more important today than ever.

    There are a million tutorials out there showing you how to build a blog in Rails (in just 15 minutes!) and how to deploy that Rails app to some cloud provider (in just 5 minutes!), but what about after that first half-hour? When the guide says "this tutorial of course isn't production ready", what actually is production-ready? Let's talk about operating Rails apps in production.

    Running a web service requires you to do so many things that aren't included in any programming books or tutorials. We need more developers able to ship services that work, rather than expecting each developer to figure out the entire list by trial and error, one at a time, by themselves. This talk covers what you need for reliable services: environments, monitoring, debugging, backups, security, and incident planning.

    As a Rubyist, you like to put intention into your code for a clear, readable, and inviting result, just like our MINASWAN community…so how can we bring that to AI? How can we get that intention while leveraging AI tools to create our Ruby solutions? Let's have a frank discussion about what can and can't help us with our coding and how, in the end, we have a better solution that allows us to work faster without losing that special spark that Ruby can have. This talk will discuss AI coding tools and prompts with purpose. The AI solution isn't always idiomatic ruby, so you know better what works for your codebase than the robots.

    Bootcamps once offered a fast, accessible path into tech—especially for career changers, people from nontraditional backgrounds, and folks historically excluded from the industry. As the industry shifts and many programs close or scale back, the landscape for learning and mentorship is changing fast. So where does that leave aspiring developers, and the folks trying to support them?

    In this talk, we'll explore how the loss of bootcamps is reshaping the journey into software development—especially for those who relied on them to break in—and what's emerging in their place. We'll look at the evolving entry paths, how mentorship is adapting without a structured pipeline, and how the Ruby community can step up to fill the gaps. Whether you're a hiring manager, an engineer (aspiring or otherwise!), or someone who loves to mentor, you'll walk away with a clearer picture of what's working, what's missing, and how we can all build more sustainable, inclusive pathways into tech—bootcamp or no bootcamp.

    Developing a turn-based web MMO using Ruby on Rails has led me through some outrageous corners of the framework's capabilities, plus required building a few fun hacks and some HTML tricks I've never seen anywhere else.

    My game, Galactic Impact [https://www.galacticimpact.com], is styled on 90s "Space Empire 4X" games: "Master of Orion", "Pax Imperia", and their ilk. It invites Users to command a fleet of ships across a two-dimensional map of stars to explore, populate, and develop worlds, while engaging in diplomacy or hostilities with other players.

    To power "game-like" user experience expectations, here are a few places I've left the beaten path of standard CRUD Apps, where Rails has cheerfully followed, often with very little hackery:
    • Extensive use of dynamic svg, both as an ActionController return format, but also setting svg elements as StimulusJS controller targets (for an application-wide PickWhip…??)
    • Storing YAML serialization of Units before and after 'combat' situations combined with Rails' built-in attribute dirty tracking to display after-action reports.
    • Sidekiq 'batching' to manage game-turn resolution sequencing for game mechanics while also parallelizing for speed.
    • A blend of integer and uuid PKs from Model to Model to distinguish and manage internal system objects v. Player-generated objects.
    • The 'new hotness' tools applied in several ways: multiple turbo-streams in form/REST responses to make snappy UI changes as a player impacts game state; lazy turbo-frames inside details/summary blocks.
    • PostGIS! Geometry-based DB for efficiently querying for ranges of Units on a 2d map.
    • Many more… (modular "Behavior" mechanism! Polymorphic "user-feature unlocking"! Redis tricks to protect existing user state during update while not blocking new user signup!)

    In this talk, we'll take a journey exploring how a series of game-oriented "Product Needs" led to each "Unexpected, but still Railsy, solution". Hopefully you'll leave with a newfound appreciation for Rails' flexibility, and if you've ever been interested in developing games, maybe it will inspire you to build with the tools you already know, instead of needing to learn another entire toolchain to bring something to life.

    Upgrading Rails is often viewed through a technical lens, focusing on version changes, migration paths, and code refactoring. Numerous talks, guides, and videos dive into this process. However, how do you navigate the organizational complexity of accomplishing the upgrade, from buy-in to review cycles? What about the soft skills aspect of inspiring a team to accomplish what seems like a Herculean effort? In this talk, we will explore the non-technical aspects of upgrading Rails that are vital for success.

    We will discuss the importance of stakeholder communication, ensuring all team members understand the reasons for the upgrade and its benefits. You'll hear strategies for managing team expectations and fostering a culture of collaboration and combined ownership. You'll even hear how to be more direct and lay out reasonable timelines for accomplishing the upgrade in weeks, not months.

    Join us to unpack the often-overlooked elements of upgrading Rails. You'll leave with actionable insights to tackle the upgrade process holistically, ensuring that both your codebase and your team are ready for the future.

    Do you remember Ruby's "Golden Age"? The era of why the lucky stiff, when frameworks like Camping and Sinatra felt like artistic expressions, and every week brought a new, delightful experiment. Ruby was the language of developer happiness, defined by a magical duality: rock-solid productivity on one hand, and playful, creative exploration on the other.

    In our collective journey to maturity, building stable, mission-critical applications, has some of that original spark been lost? Have we become so focused on the practical that we've forgotten the "kind of silly"?

    This talk argues that the rise of Generative AI isn't just a new wave of productivity tools; it's a chance to reclaim our heritage as voyagers. It's an opportunity to bring back the magic, the art, and the sheer fun of creation.

    As a Rails app grows, complexity tends to scatter across loosely defined layers, leaking through porous boundaries. Hanami 2 is a flexible Ruby framework that helps you organize complexity with clear, intentional boundaries. At the core of its philosophy is a first-class concept called slices: optional, modular boundaries that let you organize your application by feature, not just by layer. Your billing logic can live in its own world, completely isolated from onboarding or authentication, yet still integrate cleanly through explicit, well-defined interfaces. Slices can even be deployed independently, making them a strong fit for scaling both teams and infrastructure.

    Hanami chops up the traditional MVC stack into small, single-purpose layers. Each action gets its own class to handle parameters and orchestration with the rest of your system. Views are plain Ruby objects that prepare data for rendering, cleanly separated from templates. And the persistence layer, powered by ROM, encourages immutability and composability through simple data structs and repositories which access and modify data through relations.

    The result is a framework that feels lightweight but powerful: one that lets you spend your days writing Ruby, with clear straightforward APIs. Hanami doesn't dictate architecture, it gives you the freedom and tools to structure your application as you see fit. The modular monolith is not a myth: it's just that the framework for building modular Ruby apps is Hanami, not Rails. With Hanami, you spend less time bending Rails to your architecture, and more time writing focused, testable Ruby.

    Can your application's Ruby code achieve complete perfection? If you join Professor X's School for Gifted Mutation Testers, it can get pretty dang close. Discover the Mystique of transforming your code in silly (and not-so-silly) ways, and seeing if this makes your tests fail. If your tests do fail, they are solid as a Colossus! If your tests passed, then you have discovered a Rogue mutant! But do not worry: I will teach you the ins and outs of squashing that mutant like a Blob and making your code stronger than Wolverine.

    Storm into this session and learn what mutation testing is all about, see if it may be right for your Ruby codebase, and explore the tools that make it possible. We will use the `mutant` gem and delve into an example Ruby app and bring it to full mutation testing coverage through simplifying code and improving tests. Even if this technique is not right for your project, you will come away from this session with a deeper understanding of Ruby, code parsing, test-driven development, and writing clean, beautiful code.

    AI is like steroids. It can speed up the process, but you still have to go to the gym and practice the fundamentals. You have to suffer. In this talk, I will explore the art and science of writing actionable, high-context prompts that transform AI from a "hallucinating assistant" into a productive teammate, without skipping the basics.

    We will start with a brief historical overview, comparing today's Prompt-Driven Development (PDD) to the Readme-Driven Development (RDD) practices of the past. I will present practical techniques for maximizing the quality of AI-generated code by carefully tuning context, specificity, and scope, all demonstrated with concrete and relatable examples.

    I will also describe the concept of AI wrappers, the essential middleware behind tools like Cursor and Windsurf. Wrappers automatically gather context from the codebase, tailor prompts for optimal results, refine AI output, and embed changes directly inside editors like VS Code. This section will clarify why prompt engineering is a critical modern skill.

    I will also show my personal prompt collection in action. Then we will break down what makes an effective prompt and what does not, comparing and iterating live. I will illustrate why different scenarios require different types of prompts and explain why this matters for developers at all levels, not just juniors.

    To wrap up, I will outline key principles for AI-assisted development, including requirements analysis, collaborative habits, validation practices, and robust documentation. Attendees will leave with actionable guidance for integrating prompt-driven practices into their daily workflow.
