    Mastering a programming language is not enough to write efficient code. Programmers often try to squeeze a programming language as much as they can in order to achieve the best performance, without realizing that the solution could be found in a more efficient algorithm or data structure.

    The talk is meant to inspire you to learn more about algorithm design by demonstrating how a properly designed algorithm may drastically increase the efficiency of your code, regardless of the Ruby version you are using.

    Sonic PI is a free live coding synth where you can write code to compose and perform music. In this talk, I will go through the main features of the application and show how easy it is to start composing your own pieces writing plain old Ruby. Then, we will move on to the more advanced synth features, using multiple threads and sample manipulation to start producing more complex tracks. After all that, we get the party started with some live coding!

    Il paradigma MVC è ormai radicato e presente in ogni parte dello sviluppo web. Esistono però altri pattern, talvolta più flessibili ed efficienti, che iniziano a mettere in discussione l'egemonia dell'MVC soprattutto nello sviluppo frontend. La necessità di creare interfacce reattive e dinamiche trova un'ottima soluzione in Flux. In questo talk vedremo come si può implementare questa architettura all'interno dell'ecosistema Rails, e come i componenti React possono aiutarci a mantenere un frontend elegante e ben organizzato.

    Elixir is based on Erlang, but it borrows heavily from Ruby. If you understand functional programming (or if you want to), this is an excellent new language to learn. If you appreciate the beauty and elegance of Ruby, you might love Elixir, too.

    As a developer, diving in a new code base is not uncommon: you've just been hired, you change of project, you want to help an open source project, the open source library your project depends on is buggy, etc. It's like entering in a underwater cave, you don't know the treasures or the monsters you'll find there, neither if the path is treacherous or if it's a true labyrinth where you'll get lost. You can prepare yourself, you can plan your visit, you can equip yourself, you can survive and find the gem you're looking for...

    Would you like Circular Dependencies with that? In Rails we take autoloading for granted, but slow test suites and evasive multi-thread bombs too often drive us to upbraid ActiveSupport's autoloading magic.

    To dispel the magic, we will cover nothing less than the entirety of require's modest origins, the enlightening truth of Ruby execution, a selection of minimal autoload examples, the most interesting ways to break integration specs, and utopian isolation practices. All while speeding up your test suite.

    Let's be honest, in typical programming world debugging is a pain in the ass. `printf` everywhere, rerun the code every time... Such a waste of time.

    But Ruby... Ruby is different, is such a great language for introspection and live code analysis. Here's where Pry shines. During this talk we will meet Pry alongside some other tool in his universe, like `pry-rescue`, `pry-stack_explorer` and we will see how debugging a simple Ruby script or a large RubyOnRails application is easy, and fun!

    Kids have this magical ability to take something you think you understand well and turn it upside down within an instant. They challenge norms and ask questions that you never thought existed or could be asked.

    In this talk, I'll go over some of the challenges I faced introducing kids to the world of programming, and how their inquisitiveness changed the way I look at software development, how I learn to get better at it and what I want to do with it in the coming years. It has also made me a more confident and active community member, which I will outline.

    Creating a secure and strong web application can be a real challenge. There are many elements that must be taken into account including the HTTPS setup, host server and the input sanitization/authorization/authentication mechanisms.

    In this lecture we will walk through the setup of a simple, yet secure ToDO application. We will focus on the most common threats and the best practices for maintaining proper security.
