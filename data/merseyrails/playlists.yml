    We are a community of full stack Ruby on Rails developers who believe in a better way to build web-based software; one that's simple, productive, and joyful.

    We know that great software doesn't have to be cobbled together with countless libraries, volatile dependencies and spread across a dozen microservices. Rails offers a powerful, elegant alternative and we’re here to make the most of it.

    Whether you're working on your own side project, learning Rails for the first time, or looking for a break from the complexity of modern frontend-heavy stacks; you’ve found your people.
