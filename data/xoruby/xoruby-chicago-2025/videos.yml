    Do you remember Ruby's "Golden Age"? The era of why the lucky stiff, when frameworks like Camping and Sinatra felt like artistic expressions, and every week brought a new, delightful experiment. Ruby was the language of developer happiness, defined by a magical duality: rock-solid productivity on one hand, and playful, creative exploration on the other.

    In our collective journey to maturity, building stable, mission-critical applications, has some of that original spark been lost? Have we become so focused on the practical that we've forgotten the "kind of silly"?

    This talk argues that the rise of Generative AI isn't just a new wave of productivity tools; it's a chance to reclaim our heritage as voyagers. It's an opportunity to bring back the magic, the art, and the sheer fun of creation.

  event_name: "XO Ruby Chicago 2025"
  description: |-
    We often rely on concurrency in Ruby without really understanding how it works under the hood. In this talk, we’ll build a simple TCP server and iteratively improve it using processes, threads, and fibers, measuring along the way. By connecting these primitives to real-world servers like Puma, Falcon, and Unicorn, you’ll come away with a clearer grasp of how Ruby handles concurrency and the tradeoffs behind each approach.

    We know testing is vital and makes refactoring painless. But how to set sail to that TDD treasure? Yarr, we need to test to get experience, but need experience to test. Let’s draw a map with simple strategies for identifying test cases and building a robust test suite. X marks the spot w/ TDD tools for newbies and seasoned pirates alike.
