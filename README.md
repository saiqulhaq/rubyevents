# RubyEvents.org (formerly RubyVideo.dev)

[RubyEvents.org](https://www.rubyevents.org) (formerly RubyVideo.dev), inspired by [pyvideo.org](https://pyvideo.org/), is designed to index all Ruby-related events and videos from conferences and meetups around the world. At the time of writing, the project has 6000+ videos indexed from 200+ events and 3000+ speakers.

Technically the project is built using the latest [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) goodies such as [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), [Solid Queue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue), [Solid Cache](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache).

For the front end part we use [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [daisyUI](https://daisyUI.com/) components and [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/).

It is deployed on an [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=gyPLk7XJthjg) VPS with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as the main database.

For compatible browsers it tries to demonstrate some of the possibilities of [Page View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).

## Contributing

This project is open source, and contributions are greatly appreciated. One of the most direct ways to contribute at this time is by adding more content.

We also have a page on the deployed site that has up-to-date information with the remaining known TODOs. Check out the ["Getting Started: Ways to Contribute" page on RubyEvents.org](https://www.rubyevents.org/contributions) and feel free to start working on any of the remaining TODOs. Any help is greatly appreciated.

## Getting Started

We have tried to make the setup process as simple as possible so that in a few commands you can have the project with real data running locally.

### Devcontainers

In addition to the local development flow described below, we support [devcontainers](https://containers.dev).
If you open this project in VS Code and you have the [dev containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed, it will prompt you and ask if you want to reopen in a dev contatiner.
This will set up the dev environment for you in docker, and reopen your editor from within the context of the rails container, so you can run commands and work with the project as if it was local.
All file changes will be present locally when you close the container.

- Use `gh auth login` to auth with GitHub, so you can push commits from within the container.
- Do not run `bin/setup`. It starts docker containers, and you're already in one.
- After the container is set up, run `bin/dev` in the terminal to start the development server. The application will be forwarded to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).
- To run system tests, use `HEADLESS=true bin/rails test`. The HEADLESS=true environment variable ensures Chrome runs in headless mode, which is required in the container environment.

### Requirements

- Ruby 3.4.7
- Node.js 22.15.1

### Setup

To prepare your database and seed content via `docker-compose`, run:

```
# Note: this requires docker daemon running on your machine.
bin/setup
```

You can manually seed content by running:

```
bin/rails db:seed
```

### Environment Variables

You can use the `.env.sample` file as a guide for the environment variables required for the project. However, there are currently no environment variables necessary for simple app exploration.

### Starting the Application

The following command will start Rails, SolidQueue and Vite (for CSS and JS).

```
bin/dev
```

## Linter

The CI performs these checks:

- erblint
- standardrb
- standard (js)
- prettier (yaml)

Before committing your code you can run `bin/lint` to detect and potentially autocorrect lint errors.

To follow Tailwind CSS's recommended order of classes, you can use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) along with the [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss), both of which are included as devDependencies. This formating is not yet enforced by the CI.
